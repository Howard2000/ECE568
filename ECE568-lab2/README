Part 1.1 GenerateQRcode:
The QR code is generated by first convert the hexadecimal secret stored as a string to binary format. For example "0xE9" is converted to an array of unsigned bytes which
contains data such as 11101001. Then the binary form secret is encoded in Base32 which is added to the url with url_encoded account_name and issuer. 

Part 1.1 ValidateQRcode:
If we use Google Authenticator to scan the QR code generated in Part 1.1, a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) will be calculated by the authenticator. ValidateQRcode will validate 
this 6-digit TOTP code by calculate the true TOTP code. The TOTP code is calculated using HMAC encoding with SHA1. This algorithm will generate a 20-byte code which is then truncated 
into a 6-digit TOTP code. If the Google TOTP code is the same as the calculated TOTP code, we can confirm the correctness of the secret.
